Question-5
Question 5:
If u are using some programming language or scraping service,what you need  to do is to find all "img" tags,iterate over them and extract attr "href" 
from each found object.Then you probably need to normalize URL as sometimes people use relatove URL to resource .
Then when you have URL of image you can retrieve it using standard http request and save response to the filesystem as image file.
